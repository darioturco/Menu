# Mini Project Menu

As a passionate developer with a keen interest in web development, I have created a menu with numerous entries, each showcasing a unique mini-project.
These mini-projects have been developed using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS, and have helped me gain valuable experience in the basics of web development.

The primary goal of this project is to gain expertise in the fundamental technologies of web development. Each entry offers an intriguing mini-project of various kinds.
